# GIPHYGif Generator

A sample Dart Cloud Function which takes a keyword and returns the first result with giphy gif url

## Getting Started

Head over to the [Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api) to read their quick start guide and get your API key. Make sure to use the **GIPHY API** and not the **GIPHY SDK**.

Since we are retrieving an url from the API, the GIPHY API is more than enough for our needs.

## ☁️ Create a new Function

**NOTE:** If your project is not created yet, you will be prompted to create a new project.

1. Go to your `appwrite console`
2. Select your project and go to `Functions`

3. Under `Functions` click on `Add Function`

**NOTE:** If you don't see the Dart option in the runtimes. Follow `troubleshooting.md` guide to learn how to add the Dart runtime.

## 📝 Environment Variables

* **GIPHY_API_KEY** - API Key of your GIPHY account
